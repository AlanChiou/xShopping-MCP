# Examples

This folder contains real-world JSON examples of SAP tool requests and responses, based on a Rakuten Ichiba-like merchant.

Each file is named as `<tool_name>_request.json` or `<tool_name>_response.json`.

These examples are fully compatible with the [Tools Reference](docs/tools.md) and can be used for testing or documentation.

Feel free to add more examples or platform-specific variations!
